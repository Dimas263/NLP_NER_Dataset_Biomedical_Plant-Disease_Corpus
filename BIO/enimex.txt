"Projected effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="plant"> tobacco </ENAMEX> smoking on worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="disease"> tuberculosis </ENAMEX> control: mathematical modelling analysis."
"The model estimated that aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="plant"> tobacco </ENAMEX> control (achieving a 1% decrease in smoking prevalence per year down to eradication) would avert 27 million smoking attributable deaths from <ENAMEX TYPE="disease"> tuberculosis </ENAMEX> by 2050."
"However, if the prevalence of smoking increased to 50% of adults (as observed in countries with high <ENAMEX TYPE="plant"> tobacco </ENAMEX> use), the model estimated that 34 million additional deaths from <ENAMEX TYPE="disease"> tuberculosis </ENAMEX> would occur by 2050."
"CONCLUSIONS: <ENAMEX TYPE="plant"> Tobacco </ENAMEX> smoking could substantially increase <ENAMEX TYPE="disease"> tuberculosis </ENAMEX> cases and deaths worldwide in coming years, undermining progress towards <ENAMEX TYPE="disease"> tuberculosis </ENAMEX> mortality targets."
